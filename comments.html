<!--
    1. function to generate cart automatically
    2.we are using x.name instead of shopItemsData.name because shopitem is an array so it wont work
    and x is an object
    3. .join 
    4.why we did let {id,name,desc,price}= x 
    because it is destructuring makes code easier to read 
    instead of writing every time x.name x.price to fetch data
    we with this property it will save id object present in x into a variable name id
    so we now can directly fetch that variable object id
    5.we are putting id in parent selector to give the whole product 
    / or object / card an id
    6.why we put id in quantity = every time we increment the thing/product 
    we will target the id and then increment the number
    7.update function to update the number/quantity in between increment and decrement-->
